# Artistic-style-transfer <br>

Objective of the assignment is to build a model that copies the artistic style of an art to a given natural image. <br>

Install the following dependencies:<br>
torch <br>
matplotlib <br>
pillow <br>
torchvision <br>

Keep your original image and art image in same folder as the jupyter notebook. <br>
You can change the influence of the art in resultant image by adjusting weights in the loss function (clearly commented in the jupyter notebook). <br>
