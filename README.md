# Artistic-style-transfer

Objective of the assignment is to build a model that copies the artistic style of an art to a given natural image.

Install the following dependencies:
torch

Keep your original image and art image in same folder as the jupyter notebook.
You can change the influence of the art in resultant image by adjusting weights in the loss function (clarly commented in the jupyter notebook).
